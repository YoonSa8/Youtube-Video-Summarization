0,"Software Engineer, AI Intern (Summer 2025)",N/A,"About Us: We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft. We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide. Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day). This internship will take place from May - August (based on your summer schedule) and you will need to be able to work out of our NY or SF office during this time. About The Role: Millions of people use Notion — and this number is increasing every day. That means a million people trust us to deliver a fast, reliable, and secure experience, and we value this more than anything. We want to keep earning trust, while also continuing to amaze our users with the tools they can build in Notion. This is where you come in. You will be a part of our first engineering internship class and will help us forge a performant and reliable path forward to Notion's future. During your 12-week internship, you will be paired with a mentor that will help guide you as you work closely with our team to build and ship AI projects. These projects will drive valuable impact to our customers and engineers. Take a look at what our past intern cohort worked on with our Blog post here and here and TikTok post. What You'll Achieve: Write clean, secure, tested, and documented code. Design & enhance the Notion AI product with new capabilities Develop, fix and debug software for across our full stack: web services, databases, applications, tools. Qualifications: Pursuing a bachelor's or master’s degree in computer science, engineering, or equivalent. Targeting a 2026 full-time start date. Must be able to start FTE December 2025 - August 2026. Previous internship experience. Working towards a proficiency of one or more programming languages such as Typescript, Node.js, or Python. You find large challenges exciting and enjoy discovering problems as much as solving them. You are able to problem-solve and adapt to changing priorities in a fast-paced, dynamic environment. This internship will take place from May - September (based on your summer schedule) and you will need to be able to work out of our NY or SF office during this time. Skills You’ll Need To Bring: Thoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck. AI enthusiast: You have built or prototyped features with AI technologies (LLMs, Embeddings, ML) Put users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad. Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go. Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed. Team player: For you, work isn't a solo endeavor. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same. Nice to Haves: You have expertise with specific technologies that are part of our stack, including Typescript, React, Python. You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work. You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences. Our customers come from all walks of life and so do we. We hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it makes our company stronger.

2,Full-Stack Software Engineer (New graduates: United States),N/A,"Warning : if you’re outside of the Americas timezones, unfortunately, we’re only hiring for engineers with at least some timezone overlap. Wanderlog helps make leisure travel easier. We believe that travel makes the world better, and are building tools that lower the bar to it. Our core product, built starting 2019, is a travel planning app (we’re the top-ranked trip planner on iOS and Android), but we’re also helping travelers book hotels (without hidden fees), providing them with information (through various pages on e.g., best attractions, restaurants, etc.), and more. Our founders are twin brothers. Peter worked as an engineer at Stripe and a consultant at McKinsey, and Harry as a product manager at Google. We’re an engineering and product-driven team: the founders studied computer science at Yale, and have built successful, bootstrapped travel companies (BookWithMatrix and All the Flight Deals) with products people love before starting Wanderlog. We now serve millions of travelers a month, and are a team of 8, including 7 engineers hailing from MIT, the University of Toronto, UC Berkeley, and more; and 1 designer. We’re a self-sustaining, default-alive startup. We also love traveling. Whether it’s a short hop to Austin, Seattle, or New Orleans; or a longer jaunt to Australia, Hawaii, or Banff National Park (all places the team’s traveled to in the past year!), travel broadens our horizons, builds empathy, and challenges us to grow. We’re working to bring these experiences to more of the world. What You’ll Do As an engineer, you’ll be responsible for owning portions of the product. You’ll be expected to: Build new features on our website and mobile app. (Our stack is Javascript (Typescript): modern React on the web, React Native on mobile, and Node.js/Express on the server.) Design and decide what to build based on what would help travelers and drive growth. You won’t be handed a spec; you’ll be coming up with it! Build data pipelines to crawl, process, and synthesize data from various sources around the web. Write tests and and build out engineering infrastructure. Our code is fully typed (Typescript) and tested. Debug and fix bugs and scale the infrastructure as it grows. Review code written by other engineers. Be fast and nimble: figure out the best way to build new features at lowest cost in time and future technical debt. This position is a full-time role reporting to the cofounders at Wanderlog. What You Might Work On New, user-friendly hotel booking interfaces that make finding a place to stay easier. AI-powered tools that read articles and watch videos for you and summarize the places they mention. Improvements to our React Native mobile app so that it runs faster on slower Android phones. A Chrome extension to let travelers quickly compare possible places to visit, airfares, and hotels. Better invite and collaboration tools to encourage people using Wanderlog to get more friends to join them. A better profile page that lets travelers on Wanderlog show off where they’ve been, see how many people they’ve helped, and follow other friends and their trips. You May Be a Good Fit If You Are a Javascript developer comfortable with React and/or React Native. Are a product person: you’ve built products end-to-end before, and really care about the people who use them. Are comfortable with picking up various technologies for the task at hand. We quickly evaluate libraries and tools that could help our product, and variously use Redis, Elasticsearch, and Python as needed too. Are entrepreneurial: excited about joining a small, high-growth team and talking to users, doing product and design, and wearing a variety of hats. Love travel and believe in it as a positive force personally and for the world. What’s it like to work here? We’re an engineering and product-heavy team. Travel’s something everyone does, and we love using the tools we build. A typical week’s work involves talking to users, prioritizing tasks in Sheets, designing on Figma, and building and shipping them continuously. Our values include putting travelers first, owning the product end-to-end, treating teammates with respect, and moving fast by being smart about what we build and how we build it. We believe in work fitting in with your life. We love travel and believe it rejuvenates us and makes us better people, and have twice annual travel offsites where the goal is to enjoy visiting a new place and collaborate more closely with the team in person. Our hiring process We’ll first have you do an asynchronous programming challenge. If all goes well, we’ll have a coding interview where you work on a quick program on your laptop in your preferred language. We’ll then do another coding interview and a full-day virtual onsite. Founders Peter Xu and Harry Yu are twin brothers. Peter shuttled between Los Angeles, Houston, New York, Tokyo, and Hong Kong as a consultant at McKinsey before settling down at Stripe as a full-stack engineer, where he worked closely with support teams to build tools that made support agents’ work more productive. Harry worked at Google as a product manager on Hotel Search, Chrome, and finally Google Assistant for the past three, where he was one of the early PMs on the team. Before building Wanderlog, they had built Coursetable (featured in the New York Times) and travel sites All the Flight Deals (a flight deals aggregator) and BookWithMatrix (a power-traveler flight search tool). The founders are now glad to have been working on Wanderlog for 6 years, and are excited to make travelers’ lives easier!"

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.) Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward. So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots?

13,Software Engineer - New Grad,N/A,"At Pylon, we’re a small team building a very ambitious product in the mortgage space. At this early stage, we’re looking for engineers who can see the opportunity of what we’re building towards and want to have a hand in building it. We're in search of people who find difficult problems invigorating and who fit well into a high-performing team built on mutual respect and reliance. If you like pushing yourself to learn a massive amount while shipping code that has a huge impact on the end product, Pylon Engineering could be a great place for you. About You You: Have strong opinions that you’re willing to defend. We have a culture of vigorous discussion and debate on technical decisions. We’ll push you to defend your choices, and we want you to push back. Don't settle. Challenge yourself to frequently and consistently deliver exceptional code. If something could be better, take the initiative to improve it. Have great ideas, and lots of them. You should see opportunities all around you to make the code, product and infrastructure better. We’ll give you an environment where you can act on those ideas. Are self-motivated. You can take a goal and drive towards it without needing extensive hand-holding. The team is supportive and loves to share knowledge and advice, but there’s no time for micromanaging your work. Are comfortable with ambiguity. There's a million ways to do things; you should feel at ease making a decision under uncertainty while balancing competing constraints. Are confident you can learn quickly. Mortgage is complex, our platform is complex, good software engineering is complex. You’ve got to have an attitude that you can absorb it, get on top of it, and build something better than what came before. Love strong typing. We're a team full of people who love Haskell and Rust (and Idris!) and take pride in pushing Typescript to its limits. Know SQL. We use an ORM and query builder, but it’s a thin wrapper over SQL. You’ve got to know SQL inside and out to really be successful. About The Team What we’re not: Building a CRUD app: We’re building a platform that’s only possible due to deep technology investments and thinking hard from first principles. Cargo-culting what’s come before won’t be sufficient. If you’re looking to do mostly plumbing / lego piece assembling, Pylon may be very frustrating for you An easy job: We’re building a lot of things from the ground up for the first time. Working at Pylon is like a research project where you have to ship to intelligent, opinionated customers regularly. It’s basically guaranteed you’ll be handed a task that is too difficult for you to do. You might fail sometimes. You might have no idea where to start. Our team leans heavily on each other, but there’s no getting around the difficulties. What we are: A small team: We don’t have an army of engineers. If you find something is broken, you are probably the best one to fix it All the code we write has to punch above its weight in maintainability and toil reduction If you have a good idea, you have much more ability to put it into action than at a large company We need generalists: specialization is for big companies that already have everything figured out. If you’re smart, flexible and like getting into everything, we want you. Working in a regulated space: Mortgage is regulated both federally and at the state level. We move fast, but breaking things isn’t an option. About The Job Basics Job title: Software Engineer - New Grad Stock options: own a piece of the company and we all win together Health insurance, dental, etc. Our technology stack: We don’t require that you’ve worked with any of these technologies before, this is just our stack for your information: Typescript front and backend Web components GraphQL PostgreSQL NestJS web framework Nx build system Sagittarius AWS stack using CDK for declarative infrastructure We currently use ECS rather than Kubernetes. If you have questions about this choice and want to know more, please apply! General philosophy: monolith until it hurts. If we can do something without introducing a new service, we will About Pylon At Pylon we're building programmatic mortgage infrastructure. Our enterprise-grade APIs, connected directly to Wall Street, enable businesses to build and automate mortgage originations at scale. We're backed by Peter Thiel, Citi, Conversion Capital, and QED as well as the founders of Ramp, Mercury, and Blend."
