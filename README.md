In this Repo I'll create some projects related to web scrapping 

1- YouTube Channel Analytics

Overview

The YouTube Channel Analytics project is a data-driven web application that scrapes data from YouTube to analyze the highest-viewed and most-subscribed YouTube channels. The project provides insights into trends, engagement metrics, and content strategies used by top creators.

Features

Web Scraping: Extracts data on top YouTubers using the YouTube API.

Data Analysis: Analyzes subscriber count, total views, video counts, and engagement metrics.

Trend Identification: Identifies patterns in content strategies among high-performing channels.

Visualization: Generates charts and graphs to present the findings in an interactive way.

2- YouTube Video Summarizer
Overview 
The YouTube Video Summarizer is a Streamlit-based web application that extracts transcripts from YouTube videos and generates concise summaries. Additionally, the app performs keyword extraction, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis to provide deeper insights into the video's content.

Features

Transcript Extraction: Fetches the transcript of a YouTube video using youtube_transcript_api.

Summarization: Uses HuggingFace's Transformer models to generate a concise summary of the transcript.

Keyword Extraction: Identifies the most relevant keywords from the transcript using NLP techniques.

Topic Modeling: Applies Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to extract key topics.

Sentiment Analysis: Uses TextBlob to analyze the sentiment (polarity and subjectivity) of the transcript.

3- 🕵️ LinkedIn Job Scraper Module
This module automates the process of scraping job listings from LinkedIn Jobs using Selenium and BeautifulSoup. It's intended as the first step in building a candidate-job ranking system by collecting job descriptions for further analysis and embedding.
